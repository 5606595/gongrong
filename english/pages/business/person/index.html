            Tianjin Human Resources Labor Dispute Mediation Center
        </h2>
        <p>
            Tianjin Human Resources Labor Dispute Mediation Center (hereinafter referred to as “the center”) is the first non-governmental organization with respect to mediation of labor disputes in Tianjin. On August 5, 2014, the center was established in HRCLUB under the witness of Tianjin Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, the Labor Union, and the Association of Industry and Commerce. The center is the first professional, independent and socialized non-governmental third-party mediation organization. As a subordinate organ of HRCLUB and under the guidance of Tianjin Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, the center fully plays its advantages in resource integration and sets up an unbiased mediator group mainly formed by experienced human resource managers. The mediator group comes to solve labor disputes in districts of Tianjin Municipality, especially for those hot, focusing, or serious mass labor disputes, as well as the complicated ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The center is greatly characterized by being a non-governmental mediation organization whose establishment is supported by industry association through its network of mediation services. It relies on and belongs to neither sides (employer and employee), and it intends to solve disputes in an independent and just way. With the support of Tianjin Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, the center builds green communication channels with arbitration departments of every district and county of Tianjin Municipality and replaces for arbitration documents from those departments after mediation to simplify the procedures of arbitration and close cases completely. In addition, the center employed sixteen mediators made up of experts, scholars and sophisticated human resource managers at the very beginning and set the corresponding rigorous assessment system for their work. This non-governmental mediation organization is also featured by its mediator appointment rule. It is regulated that both the employer and employee can choose their own trustable mediators, which is beneficial to the proper settlement of disputes. The core idea of the center is “to reconcile”, to solve the problem of “labor relations” completely, rather than merely dealing with legal affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since its foundation, the center has received more than 520 times of consultation, including 35 mediation cases which are all successfully resolved in the end. On the other hand, the center has helped nearly one thousand people coming from the mediation organs of companies and enterprises of the primary level in mediator training and getting mediation certificates.
